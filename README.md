FeelsBook assignment for CMPUT 301

Credit for helping me with this assignment goes to Abram Hindle and his wonderful Student Picker series on youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PPD0ncJU1g&index=1&list=PL240uJOh_Vb4PtMZ0f7N8ACYkCLv0673O. Also credit is due to the course discussion page for CMPUT 301 and in particular Anders Johnson for his help with updating a listView.
